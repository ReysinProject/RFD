## The RFD Repotisory of Reysin Project

The "RFD" (Request For Discussion) process is intended to provide a defined and consistent way to propose ideas, discuss changes and document decisions related to MyEddy projects.

This process is directly inspired by others implementations of similar processes, namely [IETF's Request For Comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments), [Rust's RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs) and [Oxide's own RFDs](https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0001).

The philosophy is the same : to promote timely discussion of any ideas, rough as they may be, while maintaining a repository (and history) of other discussed propositions. As stated in IETF's RFC3:

> The content of a note may be any thought, suggestion, etc. related to the software or other aspect of the network. Notes are encouraged to be timely rather than polished. Philosophical positions without examples or other specifics, specific suggestions or implementation techniques without introductory or background explication, and explicit questions without any attempted answers are all acceptable. The minimum length for a note is one sentence.

> These standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two reasons. First, there is a tendency to view a written statement as ipso facto authoritative, and we hope to promote the exchange and discussion of considerably less than authoritative ideas. Second, there is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this inhibition.
